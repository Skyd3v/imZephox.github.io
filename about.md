I am a website designer based in the UK. I specialise in website design, 3D visualisation and identity.
I create beautiful, usable, professional websites using best practice accessibility and the latest W3C web standards guidelines, resulting in semantic and seo friendly XHTML and CSS. All my websites are lovingly hand coded.
For building websites my weapons of choice are Photoshop and Fireworks for creating layouts, then Coda to produce clean semantic XHTML and CSS. I code to XHTML strict 1. I also use Flash for animations and sometimes full Flash sites. My CMS of choice are Expression Engine and Wordpress
Currently i'm teaching myself, Objective-c and Cocoa Touch for iPhone app development.
I'm a keen user of Cinema 4D and ZBrush and use them whenever I have the chance to add any 3D elements to my projects. When I'm not in front of my computer designing, you'll find me in front of my computer(!) practicing my digital drawing, and ZBrush. I live in Glasgow, with my wife  I love to travel and I love my job!
I am currently available for freelance work.
