## Explanation

The reason for starting with pure JavaScript and then moving to refactor it into AngularJS was to acquire

the knowledge and experience that comes with using the raw language before its libraries. This better

enables me to understand and implement the extended resources on a higher level.

## Problem

To make a music player using JavaScript (and then AngularJS) that would have a desktop app-like

experience for the user. This meant having various states, using a service that allowed the playing of

media, and designing a pleasant UI for the user.

## Solution

Using HTML, CSS, vanilla JS (and then refactored into AngularJS), and some JQuery I made a basic

skeleton of an Album, Collection, and Song layout that let users see and listen to their music with little

visual noise. This involved sourcing the Buzz library, mapping out functionality of buttons during various

states of the program, and learning Grunt to use as a local server host and test the program.

## Results

The outcome was that of a usable web music player that allowed users to experience a desktop-like app

through their browser. Bloc Jams (Angular) had the capabilities to store and show album artwork,

provide a delightful musical experience of being able to play, pause, skip to next or previous songs, and

automatically play the next song when the current was finished. Having in-app volume controls is a huge

bonus that allows users to adjust the level of their music without changing the rest of the volume on

their computer.



## Conclusion

Creating this project using vanilla JavaScript was a great experience, but I definitely enjoyed the Angular

refactoring of it far better. Bloc Jams greatly contributed to my education of the language and the

available resources for it. It turned out to be a successful app that Iâ€™ve enjoyed using. Upon further

thoughts of improving it I would be inclined to add the ability for a user to directly upload their music to

the app.
