## Explanation

This was my first project completed during my enrollment in the Bloc program. I was walked through the

program step-by- step with each line of code and concept being explained in great depth. This included

demonstrating preferred formatting, logical reasoning of data relationships, and keeping the end user in

mind while coding.
## Problem

To create a full stack web application from start to finish. This included learning and using HTML, CSS,

Ruby (and how to read up on and incorporate unique gems), Rails, SQLiite, and a bit of

JavaScript/JQuery. Individual users, posts, and comments had to be created and relate together in a way

that made sense, give users proper authorization states and access to user appropriate information, and

pass tests along the way. After these were created the site would be pushed from development into

production.
## Solution

Follow along the course material and write the code in separate parts, line by line, and returning to

refactor code as necessary. Assignments prompted me to add features with little to no aid from the

course material and pushed me to learn quickly from other sources and adapt the information to my

own projectâ€™s needs. The majority of testing the app was done with Rspec and deploying the live

website was accomplished courtesy of Heroku.
## Results


A live, working mock Reddit webpage that allows users to sign up, create posts and comments, and have

a profile page.

## Conclusion

As a first project Bloccit taught me the foundational practices necessary for writing well-structured web

applications using Rails and building off of the incredible library of gems out there including Devise,

Pundit, RedCarpet, and many more. By utilizing each of these resources and understanding the

relationship between each part of the frontend and backend to themselves and each other I was able to

successfully create, design, and deploy a usable app that provides end users with an enjoyable forum

experience.
