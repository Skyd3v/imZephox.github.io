## Explanation

As the sole contributor to this project my job entailed beginning with an outline of the program later

colored in by thoughts and features I desired present in the app. This gave me free reign to choose a

direction and design I saw fit for the idea and take initiative in every aspect; from drafting a sketch to

carrying it out.

## Problem

People need a place where they can find reliable information. Other people need a place where they can

post all of the information they know to be true. Enter Blocipedia. As a Wikipedia-inspired app, its goal is

to serve as a host for information that users can write, co-author or edit existing information. There are

times when you may only want a certain group to see what you’ve written or hide it until it’s ready to be

published. Also an app where having a user profile could lead to good connection and collaboration.
## Solution

Building on my knowledge from the previous project, I decided to build this program using Rails. It’s

basic structure and layout resembles that of Bloccit, but with some behind-the- scenes differences. The

database tables are set up with a slight variation to better reflect the relationship of the data and the

features. Users can also choose to upgrade their account (configured with Stripe and its corresponding

Ruby gem) to further their account’s functionality.

## Results
A web app that allows users that sign up and make entries. This information is kept accountable by

other users having the ability to edit those entries. Upgrading an account allows users to make their

entries public or private and edit that field later should they change their mind. This also enables the

features of adding collaborators to your wiki entries and allowing only chosen individuals to make edits

to your entry.

## Conclusion

Overall a great experience in building my first app from the ground up. Needing to rely on my own

initiative to dream up and implement features helped me grow and expand my library of options and

resources. I focused mostly on the backend and incorporation of features rather than a frontend user

experience, which I would focus on next should I choose to make this a true live app. I had a few doubts

about my ability to implement a collaborators option –enabling users to specifically choose other

accounts to edit their entries— but I received a confidence boost in my resourcefulness in researching

and interpreting of the resources obtained after I dove into it and successfully accomplished the tasks I

set out to do.
